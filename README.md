The present project is a simple reaction task experiment inspired by an experiment done by Berlucchi and al (1971). Before briefly explaining the Berlucchi and al. experiment, it is necessary to explain what a reaction task experiment. It corresponds to a simple task where participants have to press a key as quickly as possible when a stimulus appears on the screen.
Berlucchi and al ‘s experiment experiment aims at presenting a stimulus in either the left or right hemifield and measuring the response times when the subject is asked to respond with the left or right hand. The stimulus is a square patch of light on a screen. 
Through this experiment, the authors seek to verify two hypotheses. First, they want to verify that cross-reaction times are faster than non-cross-reaction times, i.e., for a given visuomotor task, the hand should be faster if the stimuli are lateralized to the same side (non-cross-reaction), as opposed to the control side (cross-reaction). Next, the authors want to verify that the difference in reaction times between the crossed and uncrossed conditions increases with the distance of the stimuli from the vertical meridian. 
In order to test these hypotheses, the researchers set up a device in which a square of light flashes at different angles (5°, 20°, 35°) from the center, on the left and right hemispheres and on the horizontal meridian. When the stimulus appears on the screen, the participants respond by pressing one of the two dedicated keys, with their left or right hand. The computer records the reaction times of the participants in order to test the hypotheses with empirical data.

Nevertheless, in the framework of my project I decided to test a different hypothesis than the one of Berlucchi et al. Indeed, I chose to test the hypothesis that the color of the stimulus would have an effect on the reaction time of the participants. The computer screen being black, we can say that the very showy colors will reduce the reaction time of the participants, because of a more important contrast with the black.

Here participants have to do a simple reaction task, when they see a stimulus in the computer’s screen, they have to press the space key. 
The stimuli can have two differents colors: blue and red. The two types of stimuli appear 5 times each. At the end of each session the reaction times are recorded.
There were two players: myself and my neighbor. We each played once. After that I analyzed the data to produce a bar chart indicating if there is a difference between the reaction time to the red stimulus and the reaction time to the blue stimulus.
Based on the results, we cannot conclude that there is a significant difference in terms of reaction time. However, it would be interesting for a future analysis to test with several other colors and with a larger sample of participants.

The reaction time experiment is detailed in the following file: expl.py. Then you just have to launch in your Terminal this file if you have the expyriment package before. Running the code will automatically display the reaction time task. Participants can then take turns playing. Moreover, each time a participant finishes the experiment, the data will be automatically saved in a folder named "data". You will have to look in the document tab of your computer. 
Once all the participants have passed, you need to visualize the data and analyze it. To do this you need to run the following file: analyze_rt.py. But first make sure you have the following packages: sys, numpy, pandas and matplotlib. To be able to launch this file you just have to launch the following code on your Terminal: python analyse_rt.py data/exp*.xpd.

##Acknowledgements

This course allowed me to overcome my phobia for programming. It was not easy for two reasons. First of all, I had no basis in Python which scared me. Secondly, my computer didn't work for more than 3 weeks and froze 2 days before the deadline. But I didn't give up and I managed to make this project. Thanks to this course, I was able to understand the logic and the usefulness of programming. Finally, I would like to thank you for your patience and your pedagogy towards me.
